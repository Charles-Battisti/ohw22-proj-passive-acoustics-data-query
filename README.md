Background


Goals

USER: wants to know where available passive acoustic data from a geographic area (radius or box) at some point (or range) in time (min - max) (#1)
- depth (#3) 
	- water channel
	- source
- has / doesn't have data (#4)
	- strict / not strict (boolean)
- frequeny (#2)
	- range
	- sample rate

For future:
- Handling whether the dataset encompasses the entire time period or not

Datasets
Starting datasets will be: 
	- Ocean Observatories Initative (OOI)
	- National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
	- Ocean Networks Canada (OCN)
